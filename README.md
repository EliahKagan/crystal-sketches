# crystal-sketches - some small Crystal programs

These are small programs I wrote in 2020 while learning Crystal.

I may end up adding more to this repository at some point.

The `msf` (minimum spanning forests) program and related programs and files have
been moved to the [msf](https://github.com/EliahKagan/msf) repository.

## Other small Crystal programs

Many if not most of the small Crystal programs I&rsquo;ve written to
learn/practice Crystal are not here.

In particular, of those that I&rsquo;ve made public, many are in the
`advent-of-code` and `hackerrank` directories in
[practice](https://github.com/EliahKagan/practice).
